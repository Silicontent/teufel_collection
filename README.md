# The Teufel Collection
### A collection of Minecraft Bedrock add-ons

This is the Teufel Collection. Over the past few years, I have created five different revisions of a Minecraft add-on designed to cause as much pain and suffering to the player. All of these versions of "the pain pack," as it is called, contain varying levels of new content and game balancing. Each add-on contains a short README file describing the differences that version has. Also, the only pack guaranteed to work is the fifth and current revision. All other versions of the Pain Pack were designed in older versions of Minecraft Bedrock.

## All of these add-ons require the experimental toggle "Holiday Creator Features" to be active to work properly!!

If there are any problem with any of the packs, please [let me know](mailto:public.silicontent@gmail.com). Thank you for reading, and I apologize in advance for what you're about to go through.
