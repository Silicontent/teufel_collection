TEUFEL FÜNF by Silicontent

This is the fifth and current revision of the Pain Pack. After this, I will probably be done with these. Initially starting as a bug-fix of Teufel Vier, the scope of the project expanded to cutting down the fat that Vier had. Many of the custom items added there were removed, and the remaining items were rebalanced and tweaked. Recipes were also tweaked, as well as entities and loot tables. Overall, it is (hopefully) a more fun experience.

Fünf is really the only version of the Pain Pack I would recommend playing, as it is the culmination of fixing all of my previous mistakes to create a more fine-tuned, yet still brutally painful experience.
