TEUFEL ZWEI by Silicontent

This is the first archived version of the pain pack. The reason "Teufel Eins" isn't archived is because the second version was made by editing the original version. I never made a back-up of the original version. However, I believe Zwei is very similar to Eins besides a few tweaks (also, a few of the first custom items such as the reinforced stick, the copper dagger, and the obsidian sword were added).

These packs began the naming scheme of "Teufel" + a number (with "Teufel" being German for "devil" or "Satan," and the number also being in German).
